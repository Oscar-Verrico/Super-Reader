Hello! The **Super-Reader** project is intended as a Senior Capstone project for Appstate CompSci. Me and a friend created this program prototype in Python 3.11 that can interpret text to derive characters and create appropriate voices in an "audiobook" format, and I plan to extend more functionality for it while also minimizing computational power to have it able to run on personal machines. 

Planned features include: 
* A GUI with drag and drop functionality for easier file input and modifiable traits for identified character
* A different audio line generation system that will be more practical to modify with character factors
* A proper config file implementation, and an updated requirements.txt file as well
